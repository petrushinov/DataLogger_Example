# DataLogger_Example


About me:
This is my first project. The aim is to demonstrate my skills in compiling algorithms and their implementation. 
I'm not a professional programmer. I have over 10 years of experience in the field of hardware. 
This is the reason why my professional path turned to programming.

The project:
This is an example project of a datalogger based on the sends data to a server via wireless network. 
My plan is that project will develop in the future with more modules.

Hardware:
For wireless connection to WIFI network, my choice is  esp-wroom-02.
This WIFI module communicates with external MCU via UART with AT commands. 

More information about esp-wroom-02 https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules

The data collection server used in the project is https://thingspeak.com/

The project provides a service communication port (UART1) for configuration and error reading.
